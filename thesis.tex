The Epistolary Seminar of Informatics (ESI for short) is an annual online competition and also one of the activities of the Faculty of Informatics targeted at high school students. The central part of ESI takes place from September to April in four thematic waves. Each wave consists of at least a dozen tasks in which the participants can learn and then apply various informatics principles. Participants who earn a minimum of 60\% points for completing given tasks awarded throughout all four waves are suitable to be accepted to the Faculty of Informatics without taking entrance exams. Every year ESI has more than five hundred participants that come to solve the tasks on its current website located at https://ksi.fi.muni.cz/.

The current website is created with an outdated framework, and only a fraction of the current organizers have a needed understanding of possible issues. Because of this, the main goal of this thesis is to create a new web application for ESI, while the main focuses of the new application are on easy and effective moderation in terms of long term support.

Secondary goals of this thesis are for the new web application to make the website usable on mobile devices, present older tasks incompatible with the current website and to improve the overall user experience of the web page.

As a part of this thesis, some related modifications are also made to the server part of the ESI infrastructure.

The first two chapters are dedicated to researching other competitions similar to the ESI and their approach to their websites. The third chapter describes the ESI's server-side infrastructure. Chapter 4–6 illustrates the new implementation. Chapter 7 describes the completed application infrastructure. The resulting web application, which is a primary goal of this thesis, can be seen in use at https://ksi.fi.muni.cz/novy-web/.

The current web frontend of the Epistolary Seminar of Informatics (ESI for short) was written using the first version of the Ember.js framework. The last minor version of the first version of the Ember.js framework was released on the 12th of June 2015~[@ember-1]. The frontend stayed principally the same throughout the years because the first Ember.js version cannot be upgraded to a more recent and supported version with ease. Following the fact that Ember v1 was released in 2015, present seminar organizers face a few severe issues -- the foremost being security implications of using old and deprecated software and the secondary being the lack of volunteers with enough knowledge of this technology. In its current state, the frontend is singlehandedly managed by Ondřej Borýsek~[@ksi-web-frontend].

Since the support of the utilized framework ended, the organizers have been aware of these issues. They have tried to migrate the used version to a current stable version of Ember, most notably inside a private project called web-frontend-ember3~[@ksi-web-frontend-ember3], but these attempts were not successful. The leading explanation for the prevalence of the current frontend is that all organizers are volunteers. With only a limited time available, the organizers decided to work on more imminent duties. However, this task has gained a significant priority as Ondřej Borýsek will finish his studies shortly, and, consequently, none of the team members will be capable of resolving issues or implementing new features.

When deciding how to approach the development of the new version of the ESI frontend, I was faced with three viable alternatives. The first option was to adapt the web of any similarly focused seminar, which was deemed inappropriate because the ESI frontend has grown its backend with unique features not easily adaptable from other projects. The second possibility was to continue with a previous attempt to upgrade the frontend to the newer version of the Ember framework. This option was also discarded as there is a risk that the project would be eventually hard to manage, similarly to the current state. As per the Stack Overflow 2020 developer survey~[@stackoverflow-survey], the Ember framework is no longer used regularly and thus unsuitable for a long-lasting project.

The last option was to develop a new project from scratch using one of the most used web frameworks. Besides jQuery, which is not a full-featured web framework, the most used ones are React and Angular~[@stackoverflow-survey].

React~[@react-github], developed by Meta, is the most popular~[@stackoverflow-survey] full-featured web framework. It is focused on the fast development of responsive web applications while heavily depending on modularity and supporting it via external libraries. This modularity allows the developer to tailor the project's library set precisely for the project's needs. Since component logic in React is written in JavaScript instead of templates, it is easy to pass rich data through the applications and keep state out of the DOM~[@reactjs]. An added benefit of React is that it is taught on the Faculty of Informatics Masaryk University in a course Modern Markup Languages and Their Applications, which is compulsory for both programs Informatics~[@fi-inf] and 
Programming and Development~[@fi-pva]. Nevertheless, most of the current members of the organizer teams have no experience with web development whatsoever.

Angular~[@angular], developed by Google, on the other hand, includes most of the frequently used features~[@angular-features] like routing, HTTP client, forms manipulation, and internalization. Therefore Angular allows the developers to get familiar with a new project more rapidly without needing to learn about new libraries used within a given project first.

Because the team of seminar organizers changes quite frequently, it is crucial to minimize the entrance barrier for new developers to be capable of modifying the frontend. A lower entrance barrier can be achieved by using a well-established technology with minimal supplementary knowledge required. Concerning precisely that argumentation, Angular was chosen as more fitting and is utilized throughout this thesis.

ESI's organizers manage two virtual servers hosted on faculty's Open Nebula platform, both running Debian OS. One of these servers is for production, the second is for testing. Both share the same format - an Apache web server, which server the frontend and reverse proxies the backend.
The production server is called `kleobis` and the development `kyzikos` and I will refer to them troughout this thesis as such.

Kleobis has assigned two domains -- [ksi.fi.muni.cz](https://ksi.fi.muni.cz) for access to the frontend and [rest.ksi.fi.muni.cz](https://rest.ksi.fi.muni.cz) for calling backend endpoints.

Kyzikos has no public access, because it is meant as a development server on which the organizers can test their possibly breaking modification without interfering with the production instance.

The frontend~[@ksi-web-frontend] can be automatically deployed from its repository by building it using GitHub Actions and then copying the built web application on the desired server by calling an automated script on one of the organizers faculty accounts.

The backend~[@ksi-web-backend] has no means for automatic deployment and updating. The process has to be performed manualy, by logging into target server, pulling from the source code repository and performing a manual restart. This is a desired workflow, because updates to the backend server are infrequent and a manual check of functionality after an update increases certanity that the server will work as desired even after the update.

## Backend

The backend server~[@ksi-web-backend] is written as a Python 3 project and acts mainly as a middle-ware between the user and the database. A heavily utilized part of the backend is its capability to execute untrusted code sandboxed, which is a crucial part of the ESI. The backend is also capable of manipulating with a git repository containing data of solvable tasks.

### Code sandboxing

To sandbox untrusted code, mainly originating from participants task evaluations, ESI uses `isolate`~[@isolate] project. This project was developed for the needs of programming contests, so it perfectly fits ESI's needs. It uses so-called boxes, in which an executed command has only a limited, but fully defined, set of capabilies. This can mitigate the risk of overloading the host's system by a program stuck in nevereding loop, using the hosts network as a point of entry for an attacker, or even gaining direct access to the hosts system.

### Python web framework

The ESI backend utilizes the Falcon~[@falcon] framework for handling all HTTP API calls, which is used by companies like PayPal and LinkedIn~[@falcon-usage]. This framework is optimized for creating RESTful~[@rest] API and as such is better suitable for larger volume of incoming requests. Every endpoint is defined as a class, which has an implemented method for every supported HTTP method of this endpoint. This methods are given two parameters -- `request` and `response`. This simplicity of the framework design allows for easy and quick implementation of new endpoints and also for steep learning curve for new project maintainers.

\chapter{Swagger}

OpenAPI, formerly known as Swagger~[@swagger-about], is a set of projects that together can ease the development process for clients connecting to the exposed backend APIs. This can be achieved by the backend exposing a JSON file documenting the structure of the APIs. This structure mainly includes:

- relative paths to the endpoint inside the application
- expected HTTP method
- expected inputs, which can be inside
    - header
    - parameter
    - form
    - JSON body content
- return code and values


The client that is being implemented against this backend can take use of this information so that it precisely knowns what type of data to send and what type of the data to expect. This makes the development process easier, because it eliminates the possibility of miscommunication between the frontend and backend teams.
